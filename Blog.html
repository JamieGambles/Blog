                            itself
                            works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and
                            pushing
                            system,
                            and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is
                            being
                            changed

                            go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have
                            read it

                            for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I

                            focus.
                            Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects
