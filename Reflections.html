                            working on, in a much more visual system than using the terminal or git bash.
                            In terms of GIT I used it last year to work on a group project for a game design
                            project.
                            GIT
                            itself
                            works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and
                            pushing
                            system,
                            and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is
                            being
                            changed
                            and
                            go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have
                            read it
                            allows
                            for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I
                            can
                            see
                            being
                            very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and
                            collaborative
                            focus.
                            Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects
                            that
                            I
                            was
