                    In terms of GIT I used it last year to work on a group project for a game design project. GIT itself
                    works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and pushing
                    system,
                    and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is being changed
                    and
                    go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have read it
                    allows
                    for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I can see being
                    very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and collaborative focus.
                    Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects that I was
                    working on, in a much more visual system than using the terminal or git bash.

                    Blog Styling and Structure Development

                <div class="blogtext">
                    Worked a lot more on the structure of blog itself, I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do, such as the best way to implement the stickied header at the top. I disliked the regular way of achieving this of just giving the header a stickied position because I wanted the header in both the home page and reflections page to be inline, however with more posts the reflections page had a scrollbar and the home didn't, causing them to be out of line.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The way I ended up getting around this was actually setting the wrapper div to be the exact viewport size, so that a scrollbar is not generated. And then wrapping the blog posts within another div, this time with overflow, this meant that the header stayed constant and I could still scroll through the blogs nicely, this also meant that the scrollbar was now nicely offset from the side of the page, and I can place it neatly inline with the header with a consistent margin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After achieving this I started looking at the styling of the whole page, as well as the structure of each blog post. With my current layout of a lot of nested divs each with their own padding I was wasting a lot of space. I decided to remove the colour from each of the different div, so that a smaller margin was less jarring, I then gave each element its own div as opposed to nesting all of the 'content' together. This way I can freely reorder how the information is stacked. I also changed from using the grid system to center and scale the blog posts proportionally, as when using fractions, the blogs would become too thin when the browser was rescaled. I changed to instead using a min and max width, and then a margin on the sides of the scrollbar div. This is so that the blogs will stay at a constant size when being scaled, until the margin pushes them closer together.

                    <br>
                    Style wise I changed from my boxy appearance as that was really just there to see the margins for each div. I'm a fan of minimalist website so I went for an incredibly boring theme of black and white, using the font helvetica. I restyled the scrollbar to match this aesthetic, and added a single line border on each blog post to easily differentiate between blog posts.
