                        GIT
                        itself
                        works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and
                        pushing
                        system,
                        and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is
                        being
                        changed
                        and
                        go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have
                        read it
                        allows
                        for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I
                        can
                        see
                        being
                        very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and

                        focus.

                        that
                        I
                        was
                        working on, in a much more visual system than using the terminal or git bash.
                        In terms of GIT I used it last year to work on a group project for a game design
                        project.
                        GIT
                        itself
                        works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and
                        pushing
                        system,
                        and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is
                        being
                        changed
                        and
                        go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have
                        read it
                        allows
                        for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I
                        can
                        see
                        being
                        very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and
                        collaborative
                        focus.
                        Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects
                        that
                        I
                        was
