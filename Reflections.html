                            and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is

                            changed
                            and
                            go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have

                            for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I
                            can
                            see
                            being
                            very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and
                            collaborative
                            focus.
                            Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects
                            that

                            was
                            working on, in a much more visual system than using the terminal or git bash.
