                After struggling a whole ton with positioning and aligning things in the first practice assignment to
                replicate an existing website I started looking into css grids, this has made a huge different and with
                the blog structure even though its still very simple, I'm really happy that I could lay it out exactly
                how I wanted without too much difficulty or guesstimating.

                In terms of GIT I used it last year to work on a group project for a game design project. GIT itself
                works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and pushing system,
                and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is being changed and
                go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have read it allows
                for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I can see being
                very useful. GITs community also seems to be promising with its open source and collaborative focus.
                Github desktop worked well for me to easily switch between and manage multiple projects that I was
                working on, in a much more visual system than using the terminal or git bash.
