                                In terms of GIT I used it last year to work on a group project for a game design
                                project.

                                works really well for this. Working collaboratively GIT works well with its pulling and

                                system,
                                and it documents all of the development changes for you so you can easily see what is

                                go back to previous versions. I didn't use the branch system a lot, but from what I have
                                read it

                                for backend development and experimentation without touching the master branch which I
                                can
