                        <h2 class="datemobile">10 Oct</h2>
                        <p>Final touches on my blog. I added an image class for the case where there is only one image
                            in a post, and therefore doesn’t need to be in the slider and therefore should span across
                            the whole post, and I added the alt text of an image into the Modal. This should make it a
                            lot easier when I’m blogging to explain what the screenshots are. I also changed the scroll
                            into view method to align the content to the centre of the page, this is to accommodate for
                            smaller blog posts that won’t have their date triggered if they are scrolled to top of the
                            viewport.
                            <br><br>
                            I’m also doing a fair amount of blog catchup right now so excuse the changing tense. I feel
                            like I could write more about a lot of things, especially our continued development of
                            project 2 since our group has spent a lot of time doing work trying to figure out the best
                            way of doing things through discussion, which is hard to quantify in these blog posts. Also
                            on the figma situation, when I made my initial wireframe that is right down the bottom I had
                            a lot of angst against figma, and I also didn’t know how to use it correctly, but it was
                            still a part of the development so there it is. I could go back and make a new one, but what
                            would I make? My finished blog just in figma? I don’t know that feels like a waste of time.
                            <br><br>
                            But I’m looking at the Blog assignment on blackboard right now and prototypes seem to be
                            there so.
                            <br><br>
                            Since a lot of my blog is oriented around elements being stickied, and user interaction, its
                            difficult to prototype my final blog in figma. But it gets the idea across.
                            <br><br>
                            In terms of reflecting on my initial plan for my website, I’ll look back to the first
                            iteration of my blog that I created in the class session when we were first introduced to
                            this project.
                            <br><br>
                            Honestly I found this project difficult, I found that given a very limited objective,
                            (create a simple website where the only prerequisite is that you can record blog posts) I
                            struggled to find ways to make it interesting for myself. Especially given that my personal
                            design ethos is very minimalist/brutalist. A simple project with a simple aesthetic is not
                            what I wanted to create, however that is what my first iteration of my blog was. The
                            development process of my website has been trying to strike a balance between complicating
                            things for myself, but also so that I could put forward an ‘impressive submission’ and
                            retaining the simple structure and aesthetic that I favour. The first iteration of my
                            website visually is almost identical, if not simpler in my final iteration. It’s the same
                            black and white colours, the same blog structure, with the image at the top, and it’s the
                            same premise, just scroll down. However, I have removed the stickied nav, as the information
                            there was not relevant when the user is scrolling, and I moved to just a single HTML page,
                            as I felt I didn’t have enough information to place on my home/landing screen to justify it
                            being separate to the main content. My blog however has changed on the interaction side, I
                            added the image modal, the draggable slider, the date navigation. Only the slider was
                            planned in my early versions (at least in my head) and at that point it was a regular
                            carousel, and not what I ended up with.
                            <br><br>
                            you can imagine that the links on the landing page take you to very cool social media
                            accounts.</p>

                        <p>Finished up the remaining features that I wanted for my blog. One of the features that I
                            wanted was a way to retain my unique way of displaying the date even in mobile mode. However
                            keeping this system in a column to the side was not good as it didn’t leave a lot of room
                            for the content of my blog post, and also the ‘buttons’ of this system did not carry across
                            well to mobile as there is no way to hover over the buttons and so my dynamic cursors do not
                            work. I thought of adding text that presents as a button above and below the dates, however
                            I really didn’t like the way that this clashed with the movement of the date of an inactive
                            blog post (as they overlap when moving). My plan for mobile was to move the date system to
                            be sticked at the top of the screen and obscure the content as it is scrolled underneath,
                            functionally this worked okay, however I found that the overlaid element did not match the
                            existing aesthetic of my blog and I found it really jarring. I also had to use some
                            unpleasant ways of aligning the text to the top such as using negative margins, as the day
                            and the month dates are in different wrappers, and so can’t align normally. I ended up
                            returning to just moving the dates into the content of the blog post, and having the date be
                            unique to each blog post. This method is boring; however, it can be implemented neatly and
                            in line with my existing content unlike the other way I was trying.
                            <br><br>
                            I also gave the images in my slider a dynamic width and a set height, this is so that no
                            matter the proportions of and image, it will always align perfectly with the ones next to
                            it, prior to this if the image was taller then it would jut out awkwardly from the stack. I
                            also went through and applied all of the appropriate scaling to all of my elements when in
                            mobile mode, doing this helped me change the way I was calculating the width of each of my
                            elements to a better way, as before I was using a lot of width: 100%, and this was messing
                            with the scaling a lot, especially for the image slider. I also added a onclick modal for my
                            images, as while my slider is a nice way of storing multiple images in a blog post, it is
                            not the best for viewing images. Adding the onclick modal presented three new issues however
                            in my JavaScript.
                            <br><br>
                            The first was getting the modal to overlay only the image that was clicked, and to do this
                            in a dynamic manner so that I don’t need unique ids for every one of my images as I have a
                            lot. I fixed this by ripping code from codepen, where it uses the ‘this’ function to
                            determine which image to display.
                            <br><br>
                            The second was preventing scrolling whilst the modal was opened. When I first implemented
                            the modal I wasn’t running into the problem as I was using main as an overflow container for
                            my blogpost, however when I refactoring my scaling I removed the overflow and instead just
                            left the scrolling default, and this allowed for scrolling even with the modal open. I
                            couldn’t fix this using pointer-events: none as I needed to register a click to close the
                            modal. To fix this I went into my function that opens and closes the modal and added the
                            overflow: hidden styling to body when the modal is opened, and then overflow: auto when it
                            is closed.
                            <br><br>
                            The third problem was that because my slider already interacting with onclick for the
                            dragging function, the image couldn’t differentiate between a click, and a click and drag
                            and so would incorrectly display the modal when the user is trying to drag. I managed to
                            write the code for this as the solutions I found online seemed to be overly convoluted. The
                            code I wrote essentially records the x and y of the mouse when it is pressed down, and when
                            it is released. If the initial x and y is equal to the end x and y, then that means that the
                            user clicked, as the position of the mouse did not change whilst the cursor was held down.
                            If it did change then that means that user dragged. I then used these in if statements
                            before opening the modal.
                            <br><br>
                            Aside from implementing these things I also fixed a lot of small things and overall did a
                            lot of tidying up of my code. I placed all my media query’s CSS into one big media query at
                            the bottom and took out a lot of the placeholder divs and wrappers I had in my html.
                            <br><br>
                            Lastly, after resizing the viewport so much when working on the mobile version of my blog, I
                            found that because I had a lot of subtle animations playing, I really disliked how they
                            would be triggered on the window changing. I found some JavaScript online that disabled
                            this, and I prefer this a lot.
                            <br><br>
                            Inline with this kind of fix I also added some CSS which disabled the awkward blue highlight
                            that appeared in the mobile version, in place of this I reformatted my landing page so that
                            size of the buttons regardless of where the text is always equal to the width of the landing
                            page, this way I can add a onclick effect for mobile where the ‘background’ of the button
                            flashes a slightly darker grey indicating the ‘hitbox’ of the button. Initially I was
                            planning on changing this back to how I had it originally on the desktop version, where you
                            had to hover your cursor of the text to get the hover effect, however I ended up really
                            liking seeing the hover effects just when the cursor was at the same height of the button.
                            This also let me implement my custom cursor to the blog button which is an arrow aiming
                            down. I had thought of doing this earlier, but I figured that the overlapping lines of the
                            hover effect of the button combined with the custom cursor would be too much.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">08 Oct</h2>
                        <p>I spent time in class trying to get the carousel-like navigation of our group project website
                            set up. My thinking for this is that the website will essentially act as two carousels,
                            there will be one vertical one that contains the home screen and then below that another
                            frame for the content of the website. That frame for the content will then act as one big
                            carousel, which will include the Nominations page, index, about us page, and the editors
                            page. My reasoning for making this system out of carousels is that in my previous iteration
                            of this website I used overflow containers, and then used JavaScript to scroll left and
                            right when a button is pressed. This system worked well and was very easily to implement,
                            however a big issue with it is that it wasn’t responsive, when the website is scaled, the
                            sections wouldn’t align to the centre of the page, and you would be left looking at the
                            middle area of two sections. I also hadn’t found a way to ‘lock on’ to a section when
                            scrolling using this method, as I was using absolute values when scrolling which of course
                            would not work when I added the pages, and when the page is resized.
                            <br><br>
                            Aside from the carousels I also looked at importing our symbols that Jack is designing as
                            SVG’s rather than PNG’s, this is so that applying hover effects to our buttons is a lot
                            easier, as we wouldn’t need to manually export all of the symbols in their different
                            colours, we could just change their fill. Blaine sent an email after class with some
                            examples of this in use, so I will look at implementing this soon.
                            <br><br>
                            We are still discussing the colour scheme that we have chosen for our website, one the
                            critiques that we got when we were presenting our prototype was that the yellow with black
                            or white text was not the most readable. Now we have a main colour of an army green? -ish
                            colour, and then we still using our yellow, but just as an accent colour. We changed to this
                            one as our previous change to a navy blue made the website look to much like Facebook.
                            Ultimately, I don’t really mind the colour that we with now, I’m leaving that up to the
                            others as I want to focus on the coding of the website.
                            <br><br>
                            As a Segway to coding, I am finding it difficult having a number of us all try and code the
                            website. Originally the plan was to have just me, and Madisyn do the coding, I would focus
                            on the more technical aspects, while Madisyn would focus on laying out the pages correctly.
                            Kat however has started doing some of the coding, and in a very different manner to how me
                            or Madisyn would do it, and even further, since she is copying and pasting from sources
                            online, if we run into issues with segments that she has made, then she can’t help us
                            resolve them as she doesn’t understand the code. I think I will have to end up remaking the
                            areas she has done which is a shame as that happened a fair bit in the Figma document as
                            well, but what she is doing slowing us down.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">07 Oct</h2>
                        <p>I was in a call with one of my friends from home who has done a bit of Web design so I asked
                            if she could give me feedback on my Blog. Today I had spent time reworking the layout of my
                            landing page, so it was the first time my blog was looking somewhat like a complete website.
                            Her two main critiques were that the colour change between my landing page and my blog page
                            felt jarring and didn’t help to create the seamless effect that I was going for by using one
                            html page. The second critique was similar, and it was that my Landing page being left
                            aligned, and with a margin of 75px, felt disjointed to my blog which instead had an auto
                            margin and was centre aligned. I took onboard this feedback and changed the colours, and
                            then I first started exploring creating a horizontally centred landing page however nothing
                            that made I ended up liking and so I started exploring a left aligned blog.
                            <br><br>
                            This ended up being a fantastic design change, as having it left aligned meant that I didn’t
                            have to worry about leaving equal width to the date column padding on the right side of the
                            blog in order to centre it correctly, so left aligning game me a lot more working room with
                            padding. Achieving this however was frustrating, due to how I had coded the dates column to
                            function. I ended up fixing this, however it did result in me having to place the date
                            underneath the blog post in my HTML, which I am not a fan of.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">06 Oct</h2>
                        <p>Tuesday class session I went over the initial framework that I had created for our website
                            with our group, and then I spent most of the class in getting Kat up to date with our git as
                            she wasn’t familiar with how to update her branch so that when she does work she is doing it
                            on the latest version of git. While doing this me and Madisyn started structuring the
                            editors page and the about us page
                            <br><br>
                            After class I continued to work on my blog. I created the first iteration of my landing
                            page, which took me a long time as I couldn’t create a good layout. Feels a bit like karma
                            for not spending the time to work through figma and create a proper wireframe. My initial
                            versions had a small bio to the right of the social media links; however, I didn’t like
                            right aligning to mirror what I did for the social links, and everything felt way too
                            cramped when I centre aligned it. My fix for this was to remove it. I didn’t really like
                            having a bio up there anyway, everything I wrote sounded pretentious and cliché. I think a
                            bio is more suited towards a portfolio website and not a blog about some mediocre web
                            design.
                            <br><br>
                            I continued working on the blog and when looking for exemplar work, I came across an article
                            which felt very topical towards my landing page design. I can’t find it now but essentially
                            it was a critique of the commonly used ‘explore’ button on landing pages that when clicked
                            scrolls the user down to the beginning of the websites content. I agreed with a lot of the
                            points made in this article, prominently being that ‘good design’ would not need a prompt
                            telling the user what to do, the user would now what do through the design alone. Since my
                            current landing page featured a similar button, saying ‘blog’ underneath my social media
                            links, I looked at the suggested alternatives. The most suggested being to ‘peak’ the
                            content from the bottom of the page, this works by showing the user that there is content
                            further down, and therefore they naturally scroll down. I have already implemented this
                            technique in my slider, by locking the image width to 90% there is always 10% of the next
                            image show, hopefully showing the user that they can drag to the left to reveal more. I
                            added this feature to landing page by peaking the blog out from the bottom, but nothing I
                            did looked right. I think because a lot of my design is incredibly minimal, it felt wrong to
                            break the strong lines that I had established. I still think there is a better solution than
                            the button that I have right now, but I think its better than peaking the content.
                            <br><br>
                            I also hopped in a call with Jack and got his opinion on my font choices as I wasn’t liking
                            them as much now. At the time I was using IBM Plex Sans condensed as header text, and the
                            Helvetica for my body text. This combination was okay, I really wanted to use the IBM font
                            as I am a big IBM fan, using Helvetica felt like a cop-out but as Jack mentioned my website
                            was designed in a manner that Helvetica complimented. He suggested that I use Helvetica bold
                            as my header text, but I really couldn’t do that as that is what I always do I’m trying to
                            do something a bit more considered here. After a lot of debating I settled on changing the
                            header text to the regular IBM Plex Sans Bold, and then I used Montserrat as my body font.

                        <p>Although bland and minimal is the aesthetic I am going for with my blog, I decided that I
                            wanted something a little interesting. I ended up choosing to go for a very subtle animated
                            noise effect that plays in the background. Looking online there were a few ways to achieve
                            this, however the most common was to create a noise texture in photoshop and use CSS to
                            animate it moving in a square like pattern giving the illusion of noise being animated. I
                            didn’t want to go this route as it felt like cheating. I would much rather generate the
                            noise and have it correctly animate, even if the effect is very subtle. I found what I
                            needed on codepen and placed it my code and it worked fantastically, I can use opacity to
                            increase and decrease its strength as well.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">04 Oct</h2>
                        <p>The implementation of my scrolling system gave me a unique opportunity for my website, where
                            the section in the middle of the viewport would be given the class of active, this meant
                            that I could dynamically change the colour of it as an example. When I first implemented
                            this, I used this as a method for troubleshooting, as it was easy to see which one my system
                            thought was active. The code that I ended up using for the slider included an interesting
                            effect where by default the slider would be at a scale of 0.98, and then only when the
                            cursor is held down it, does the scale change to 1, I felt that this created a really
                            interesting feeling of tactility and depth, and so I added a similar effect to my blog
                            posts, by default they are at a scale of 0.98, and then when they are given a class of
                            active, and are therefore the currently viewed post, they scale up. These effects combined
                            with a transition of 0.2s give a lovely feeling of fluidity and dynamism to my blog.</p>

                        <h1>Carousels and sliders</h1>
                        <h2 class="datemobile">03 Oct</h2>
                        <p>I used the work that I did on our group project as inspiration for my blog today, where I
                            finally implemented my version of a carousel for my blog posts images. This was a highly
                            considered decision as I had spent a lot of time messing around with different carousel
                            ideas, and I kept coming back to some core issues. The number one being that all the
                            carousels I could find online relied on a class system, which because of this, would not
                            work with multiple iterations, as each of the carousels would scroll if one was scrolled.
                            The second was that unless all of my images were the same size and proportion, then unless
                            my blog posts height dynamically changed based on the position of the carousel which I
                            imagine would be incredibly jarring, then there would be awkward white space underneath
                            images that weren’t as tall as the tallest image in the carousel. With my ethos of doing
                            things only if I can implement them in seamless and pleasant manner, I wasn’t happy with
                            these issues. I considered just making sure that all my images were of the same proportion,
                            my mind immediately went to Instagram with their square proportions, which I find very nice,
                            however a large issue with that is that since I would be mostly taking screenshots of my
                            website, it made no sense to use square images as not matter what I did aspects of the
                            website would be cropped out.
                            <br><br>
                            My solution was to implement a user-dragged carousel, where the carousel is slid across by
                            the user clicking and holding and moving their cursor, the nice thing about this is that
                            there is no buttons so it works well with the my ‘custom cursor’ button design, it’s also
                            very fast, and it can work in multiple iterations, after I made a small adjustment to the
                            existing code, where using a for loop it can affect all of the carousels.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">02 Oct</h2>
                        <p>Today I figured that I should probably spend some time working on our group project as we are
                            supposed to have started coding it by now. I went through and built out a very rough
                            framework. I used the same technique I used in my last iteration of this in order to get the
                            pages on one big ‘screen’ that can be scrolled left and right, which is using and overflow
                            wrapper, and aligning all of the different pages in grid columns which a width of 100vw.
                            This has its issues but its and easy way to get the content out there so that if the other
                            want to start doing work they can start on any of the pages and don’t have to wait for me to
                            create the final system with all of its functionality. After doing this I pushed this to the
                            master of our git project, and then made branches for everyone so that if they would like
                            they can start working on the content of our website.
                            <br><br>
                            I spent the rest of today polishing the scrolling effect that I finally got working
                            yesterday and bringing across from my test website to my blog. The first thing I did was
                            apply the same effect to the months as well as the day so that they can scroll individually.
                            I’m sure there is a way to optimise the JavaScript for this, but essentially all I did was
                            copy the same code, and use different variables, in this case it was sxnday/sxnmonth, and
                            idxday/idxmonth. I should also explain a bit of how this works, because while I started with
                            existing code, I ended rewriting the whole thing anyway, however using that existing code
                            helped with me understanding the logical process of what needs to happen. Essentially an
                            array is initialised of all the sections, day or month. A new variable is then made = 0,
                            idx, then by manipulating this idx variable and then using it as the value for the array
                            like sxn[idx] we can ‘select’ a section. There are two ways to change the value of idx, the
                            first is by using the next and back buttons which respectively add 1 or subtract one,
                            idx++/idx--, the second is by scrolling, for this I created an event listener, that when the
                            user scrolls, it records the distance from the top of the current ‘active’ section and the
                            top of the viewport. We can then use if statements to say that if the bottom of the active
                            section is negative, and therefore greater than the top of the viewport, the active section
                            must have been scrolled past entirely, in which case we can add 1 to idx, and set the
                            section below the one just scrolled to active. This then repeats and is also mirrored for
                            when the top of the active section is below the bottom of the viewport, we can subtract 1
                            from idx.
                            <br><br>
                            Once we have established which section is ‘active’ we can then run a function that when one
                            of the next or back buttons is clicked, it will scroll to either idx++ or idx--. I’m really
                            proud to have made this system as it turned out be quite complex, and this is my first time
                            doing pure JavaScript.
                            <br><br>
                            To polish this effect I emulated an effect from one of my favourite websites
                            https://dasprogramm.co.uk/, where they use a carousel with buttons that change the cursor to
                            an arrow in the direction of the movement of the carousel. I placed this new style of
                            buttons on top of the columns for the dates at all times, and then used grids to place the
                            next buttons on the bottom half of the screen and the back buttons on the top half of the
                            screen. This resulted in a fantastic and in my view very intuitive system of navigation.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">01 Oct</h2>
                        <p>This morning I finally got this effect that I have been working on for my blog complete. I
                            knew that with my new date system I wanted a way to quickly scroll through the dates of
                            blogs as opposed to scrolling through every single blog post. My solution to this was making
                            forwards and back buttons that scroll and entire month, I implemented this very simply at
                            the beginning however the big problem I was running into was that if you clicked the next
                            button and got taken to blog post 2 for example, and then manually scrolled down to blog
                            post 5. The buttons wouldn’t recognise that change and therefore if you then clicked next
                            you would be taken to back up to blog post 3, as that is 1 greater than the blog post that
                            the button last took you to. This problem meant that I needed to create a system where the
                            blog post that is currently in view no matter how you got to it, would be the post that
                            would be used to reference where forwards and back should be from.
                            <br><br>
                            To avoid having to deal with unnecessary issues I made new test website to create this
                            effect. In the current iteration of it I have it set up so that as you scroll down, the
                            section that is currently intersected by the top of the viewport is assigned as the active
                            section indicated by its red stroke. The buttons at the top then set the active section to
                            either +1 or -1 from the current active, and then smooth scroll to it.</p>

                        <p>Last class on Thursday Madisyn made a checklist of the work that we needed to do on our
                            website based on the feedback we received from our presentation, the feedback we received in
                            the email from Blaine, and the feedback we received in our user testing. This was very
                            helpful in delegating tasks as we new specifically what needed to be done. At the forefront
                            for a lot of our changes was the filter system. The feedback we received was that it was not
                            obvious at all what the function of this was. There were a few solutions tossed around
                            however we landed on the fact we needed to text somewhere in the filtering icons to give a
                            bit of context as to what they do, we also needed to make look more like buttons.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">28 Sep</h2>
                        <p>I have been struggling with my blog, a lot of motivation has been lost. I really like this
                            date system that I have going on, but it seems to be messing with how I lay my page out, and
                            I have this idea, where the user can use the date ‘column’ also as navigation, by pressing
                            next/back on either the day or month. Initially I thought that this would be easy to create
                            as I had implemented something like this last year in a website, I made for interaction
                            design. However, that website only had 8 pages, and therefore it was reasonable to have two
                            buttons on each page, both that link to the next and previous pages respectively. However,
                            the issue that I faced in my blog is that there will be a lot of posts and having a unique
                            button on each would be problematic. And so, I needed a dynamic system, where a next button
                            would know which is the next post without being explicitly told. AND, because the user can
                            scroll as well as use the buttons to navigate, I needed the system to be constantly aware of
                            the what is the current screen, and therefore what the next and previous screens would be.
                            All of this was overwhelming, and I don’t/didn’t really know pure JavaScript, I’ve done a
                            fair bit of P5, but that can only help to a certain point.
                            <br><br>
                            I put my name down for an ‘interview’ with Blaine, so that I could explain this system to
                            him and see if he could help me getting it to work. Prior to the interview I found some code
                            online that said that it did the thing that I needed it to do, which it did, kind of. It
                            would scroll forwards and back dynamically, however it had issues, it didn’t update itself
                            when the user scrolled manually, and it also had this weird thing where the buttons would
                            activate if you just clicked on a different section other than the one you were viewing. I
                            think this was because this system was designed around the idea that each ‘screen’ would be
                            equal to the viewport size, so this wouldn’t normally be possible.
                            <br><br>
                            I ran into a lot of luck with my interview with Blaine, the 3 people who were supposed to be
                            after me never showed up, and so I was able to talk to him from 3:15 to 5:00. In this time,
                            we managed to fix the buttons so that they would only be called when clicked, and Blaine
                            headed me in the right direction with figuring out the dynamically updated position thing.

                        <p>Mmmm time to present. I wasn’t there when this happened but apparently Blaine had came over
                            to our group and suggested that the least vocal of the group should present, which to me
                            sounded like a fantastic idea, however Cindy and Kat both defended themselves by saying that
                            they know nothing about the website, and so if they were to present they would make our
                            website look bad. Personally, I was completely okay with this, but as a group we decided
                            that we would all go up and present, which was a strange metaphor for yes Jamie can present.
                            <br><br>
                            Overall the presentation went well, I think we got some good feedback, and this put us in a
                            good position to continue developing our website.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">22 Sep</h2>
                        <p>This morning our group of 5 all met up on campus and worked further on our prototypes. This
                            was also a productive session, probably the most productive session we ever had. I think
                            that says something about our class sessions.
                            <br><br>
                            After doing as much as we could do before class, I quickly setup the prototyping with
                            Madisyn so we were ready to present.
                            <br><br>
                            Everyone thought that we were supposed to be presenting our prototypes to the class today
                            hence the last the second rush, however apparently it was just to email to Blaine, and then
                            we would be presenting alongside our newly introduced user testing results. In hindsight
                            this was probably for the best, as the prototype that we ended up with was nice and felt
                            like a huge leap forward from what we had before.

                        <p>Me, Madisyn, and Jack hopped in a call to help Jack out with his redesign. I think this was a
                            very productive session. Essentially, we applied the aspects of Jacks design that we liked,
                            primarily his index page, and then applied them to the other pages.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">19 Sep</h2>
                        <p>I’ve been focussing on other projects, so I called Jack to check out how he was going with
                            the redesign. At this point Jack had done the home screen, the index screen, and the
                            nominations screen. I really loved what he had done with the index page, and the decision to
                            remove the awkward side navigation bar that I had created was great, as it broke down the
                            structure that we had been confined to recently. His use of yellow and just the generic
                            laying out of each of business cards was fantastic. However, I really didn’t like his layout
                            for the home screen, and I even more disliked his version of the nominations page. The
                            biggest issue that I had with both, was that I didn’t follow the same alignment that we he
                            had laid out in the index page. Because Jack was being careful to not make any of the work
                            any of our other team members had done redundant, Jack had left in Kats vertical ‘logo’ on
                            our homepage, and the awkward description of the business of the day. Due to the vertical
                            and left aligned logo, Jack had then treated the ‘centre’ of the page, as the centre of the
                            area that was left when you don’t consider the logo. This is where he aligned this text. I
                            felt very strongly about this. On the nominations page Jack had this idea that the
                            horizontal nav from the index would continue across the top of the nominations page two, and
                            then wrap around the outer edge where the white space would have been. Jack then used the
                            true page centre to align the elements of this page, I found this very jarring, since the
                            change in background colour between the white and yellow made the alignment of the content
                            very difficult to see, and it felt very floaty, the same could be said for the home screen.
                            Because Jack is my friend, I didn’t mind bringing up these critiques.
                            <br><br>
                            One of my other semi-critiques, was that Jack wasn’t using grids in figma to align things,
                            and because this everything was out of whack. I showed Jack how to use them, in which he
                            told me off for not telling the rest of the group earlier and allowing them to make
                            unaligned content which is fair. But I was trying to dial back my influence on the group as
                            I felt like I was making too many of the decisions.

                        <h2 class="datemobile">17 Sep</h2>
                        <p>Due to the looming pressure of having to present a fully prototyped website we have all come
                            to the collective decision that designing a website between 5 people is the worst thing in
                            the world and only leads itself to either inconsistences, or people not getting what they
                            want.
                            <br><br>
                            Almost collectively we have decided that Jack over the weekend will create a redesign of our
                            website, while retaining the generic form. I am very keen for this as I have a lot of faith
                            in Jacks creative decisions, and I think that at the moment we are stuck in a rut of being
                            confined to the early block frames that I initiated, which while they get the idea across
                            around how our website should function, it really is not the best thing I have done, and its
                            causing a lot of issues.

                        <p>Tuesday Class session, we spent a bit of time discussing with Josh and Blaine our wireframes
                            so far, we then split off into two groups. Me and Madisyn beginning coding our website, and
                            Jack and Cindy tidying up our figma documents and finalising our style guide. Me and Madisyn
                            worked together to get the rough outline of the index page setup. Retrospectively this was a
                            bad idea.</p>

                        <p>Another discord call with the group, we each went through the wireframes that we made and
                            discussed what was good and what we thought needed changing. We then used the wireframes we
                            had made to start deriving a style guide.
                            <br><br>
                            After this I did more work on the blog, I added in a feature that I have been planning for a
                            bit, essentially the date is show in 3 columns on the left hands side, when you scroll the
                            elements are all sticking to the blog posts that each element is relevant to, then when you
                            scroll past the end of a blog the new date will scroll up with it and then become stickied
                            at the same position as the old date. This is a bit of a gimmick, but I like to think that
                            it helps to better visualise the passing of time between each blog post.

                        <p>Thursdays class was not amazing, so I told everyone that I would go off and create a properly
                            prototyped block-from of my idea for the website. We all got on Discord, and I showed my
                            prototyped block frame and together we assigned content to work on to each member of the
                            group.
                            <br><br>
                            The overarching idea for my blockframes is that all of the content is one HTML page, and to
                            get to each of the different segments of the website, a button is pressed and all of the
                            central content slides across revealing the new content. This then creates the illusion the
                            content is all on one large plane, and the viewport is moving to view different content. I
                            then have a horizontal stickied bar on the left that containes the filtering system for the
                            businesses on the index page.</p>

                        <p>Before class I went around to Jack's again to discuss our project, we had a good talk and seemed
                            to be on the same page about locking down the framework of our website before everyone
                            started doing their own thing. During class I pitched my idea for navigating the website to
                            group as there was a lot of inconsistencies between everyone’s block framework, and I wanted
                            to stray away from the traditional ways of navigating a website. This could of gone a lot
                            better, because my idea was still fresh I did not have enough supporting to visuals to
                            explain my ideas, especially through and online class. Desipite this based on my pitch we
                            rearranged our user flow to line up with this idea.</p>

                            opted to do the Nominations page however I found it difficult to start designing the page
                            without having the framework of the website really locked down. Everyone started doing their
                            own versions of navigation bars and I really felt like before we started designing anything
                            we should have properly sat down and came up with the general framework of the website, so
                            that we can better design each page.</p>

                        <p>Our first work session in our group. We pitched our ideas for our website. I pitched two
                            ideas, one was a simplified app that made catching a bus a lot simpler, and the other was a
                            Pinterest board inspired site where you could take notes and drop images. Jack pitched a
                            Chicken Nugget review website; Madison pitched a website that was an index of businesses
                            where the user could easily navigate through and find the service that they were after. Kat
                            pitched a website that acted as a database of work examples for Victoria university
                            projects. After talking a bit with Josh, we chose Madison’s ideas, as Josh warned us that
                            creating websites with databases would be difficult, and that ruled out pretty much all of
                            the other suggestions. We then further discussed our website with Blaine, where he suggested
                            that we narrow our scope further, and target specific businesses, from this we chose to
                            specifically do hospitality businesses that we curated under 4 categories, cost, charity,
                            environment, and local.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">18 Aug</h2>
                        <p>After doing the dark mode tutorial I had an attempt at implementing p5.js into my blog
                            because I wanted to create some nice effects to go in the background of the home page.
                            Getting p5 seamlessly into html I found difficult, I ended up using an Iframe and linking
                            the JavaScript in. Although I still had a lot of issues in making the iframe responsive I
                            eventually got it working. One of the effects that I am really interested in is parallax, so
                            I quickly created this faux 3d cube that changes perspective based on where the mouse is. I
                            liked this effect, but I didn’t like how it was always just a background element, and I
                            couldn’t interact with the objects I was drawing through the iframe like a pressing a
                            button. I looked at this website through awwwards https://activetheory.net/home and chose to
                            try and replicate the parallaxes button on the home page. While I don’t think that I will
                            use this specific effect in my blog, it was a good experiment in learning how to implement
                            more complicated use of JavaScript into websites.</p>

                            class on Thursday. I found this one easy using the JavaScript that was included in the
                            example site, and then adding classes and containers around the content in the flexbox
                            tutorial to fit. My dark mode is not the prettiest thing, but I got the hold of how this can
                            be used fast.</p>

                        <p>I did the exercise that was introduced on Tuesday’s class today, which was our introduction
                            to JavaScript. We needed to make a page that had two buttons which allowed the user to
                            switch between two static images. I decided that I would go a step farther using my
                            incredible knowledge of if statements, and make the same system with one button, that
                            switches the image back and forth, I then used this system to make a shit meme, which was
                            supposed to be jack dancing.</p>

                        <h2 class="datemobile">11 Aug</h2>
                        <p>Hand in for our wireframes today. Very hectic. My time management for this project really
                            hasn’t been the best, I had rough wireframes done for both outcomes done this morning
                            however I really underestimated the work I needed to get done. I went to class with just my
                            report yet to write for the hand-in at 5, however after talking to josh I found that the
                            wireframes that I had done were too close to block frames and that I needed to work more on
                            incorporating the styling that I wanted for each website into the wireframes. Blaine gave me
                            an extension til midnight to hand-in which helped hugely. I finished writing the report that
                            I had started in class, and then went about restyling a lot of the wireframe components. The
                            main areas that I redesigned were the navbars for both the wireframes, and the ‘card’ that
                            portrayed the information of a class. I also went about redesigning each of the interactable
                            objects to make it clear that they could be clicked on.</p>

                        <h1>I am starting this way too late</h1>
                        <h2 class="datemobile">10 Aug</h2>
                        <p>I’m doing most of the ‘designing’ of the wireframes tonight. My first and in my opinion best
                            of the two wireframe ideas is a sort of backtracking system. Where the user starts at their
                            last year for their chosen degree, and then as they select papers for that year, the pre
                            requisite papers that they would have needed to have taken in order to take those papers in
                            their last year are automatically added to their previous years and a line is drawn between
                            each of the classes.
                            <br><br>
                            The intentions behind this design is that by the end of selecting their papers the user will
                            have a ‘tree’ like diagram that represents the direction that they have taken each course.
                            <br><br>
                            My other idea a lot simpler and more traditional, there is a navbar at the top which allows
                            the user to switch between years and the select degree page. On each page for a specific
                            year the user can drag and drop papers from a search box and into tabs for each of the
                            trimester. As they do so their point totals and requirements will change dynamically on a
                            tab on the same page. The intention behind both of my designs is to give a sense of
                            tactility and weight to their selections outside of dropdown menus, and to very clearly show
                            the prerequisite papers that need to be taken in order to complete their selected degree.

                        <h2 class="datemobile">30 Jul</h2>
                        <p>Thursday Class session, we didn’t have any exercises to do today, we did a bit of a catch up
                            on the work that we are doing for project 1. I started to familiarise myself with figma a
                            bit more and worked out the grids tool within frames which is helping immensely with laying
                            elements out proportionately and keeping consistent padding. I don’t know what either of my
                            website wireframes will be just yet, but I do know that I will be going for 2nd brief option
                            where we are tasked to create a course selection planner for the Victoria university
                            website. At the moment I am thinking of creating a system that works backwards, where the
                            user starts in their last year selecting papers, and then works their way back to their
                            first year. The reason for doing it this way is so that the requirements for third year
                            papers are made a lot clearer as they would be added to the previous year’s automatically.

                        <p>After working on the structure of my blog yesterday I started looking at the styling of the
                            whole page, as well as the structure of each blog post. With my current layout of a lot of
                            nested divs each with their own padding I was wasting a lot of space. I decided to remove
                            the colour from each of the different div, so that a smaller margin was less jarring, I then
                            gave each element its own div as opposed to nesting all of the 'content' together. This way
                            I can freely reorder how the information is stacked. I also changed from using the grid
                            system to center and scale the blog posts proportionally, as when using fractions, the blogs
                            would become too thin when the browser was rescaled. I changed to instead using a min and
                            max width, and then a margin on the sides of the scrollbar div. This is so that the blogs
                            will stay at a constant size when being scaled, until the margin pushes them closer
                            together.
                            <br><br>
                            Style wise I changed from my boxy appearance as that was really just there to see the
                            margins for each div. I'm a fan of minimalist websites so I went for an incredibly boring
                            theme of black and white, using the font Helvetica. I restyled the scrollbar to match this
                            aesthetic and added a single line border on each blog post to easily differentiate between
                            blog posts.

                        <h2 class="datemobile">25 Jul</h2>
                        <p>Worked a lot more on the structure of blog itself, I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do,
                            such as the best way to implement the stickied header at the top. I disliked the regular way
                            of achieving this of just giving the header a stickied position because I wanted the header
                            in both the home page and reflections page to be inline, however with more posts the
                            reflections page had a scrollbar and the home didn't, causing them to be out of line.
                            <br><br>
                            The way I ended up getting around this was actually setting the wrapper div to be the exact
                            viewport size, so that a scrollbar is not generated. And then wrapping the blog posts within
                            another div, this time with overflow, this meant that the header stayed constant and I could
                            still scroll through the blogs nicely, this also meant that the scrollbar was now nicely
                            offset from the side of the page, and I can place it neatly in-line with the header with a
                            consistent margin.
                            <br><br>
                            After achieving this I started looking at the styling of the whole page, as well as the
                            structure of each blog post. With my current layout of a lot of nested divs each with their
                            own padding I was wasting a lot of space. I decided to remove the colour from each of the
                            different div, so that a smaller margin was less jarring, I then gave each element its own
                            div as opposed to nesting all of the 'content' together. This way I can freely reorder how
                            the information is stacked. I also changed from using the grid system to center and scale
                            the blog posts proportionally, as when using fractions, the blogs would become too thin when
                            the browser was rescaled. I changed to instead using a min and max width, and then a margin

                        <p>Spent the class time experimenting with how to do my blog. After struggling a ton with simply aligning things
                            vertically in our first mini assignment to replicate an existing website josh had told me
                            that I should be using CSS Grids. I used these in my mock-up for my blog as more of a proof
                            of concept, but I ended up really liking it. Grids work fantastically and made the whole
                            experience a lot more enjoyable for me as I enjoy a highly structured system to worth
                            within. With this early version of my blog I am not too worried about styling as I can
                            always come back to that, I am more focussed on creating a layout for the content that makes
                            sense and is easy to navigate. Here is the first iteration of the home page and reflections
                            page that I created, the home page is very simple because I’m really not too sure on what I
                            need to have on there so at the moment it just has the button that links you to the
                            reflections page. The reflections page is very simple as well, just containing a singular
                            ‘card’ layout for a single post.
                            <br><br>
                            After doing this I then went about creating wireframes for how I imagine that my blog will end up. I want to mantain a very minal style, limiting my colours to only grayscale. I like the idea of bringing in contrast between the home/landing page, and the reflections page so I used a black background for the home, and white for the reflections. For the image section of the blog post, I know I want a carousel, but I don't want buttons. I want to explore the idea of using custom cursors to indicate if a section of the blog is clickable, and if so what it does. I'm thinking that in case they will be small arrows that point in the direction that the carousel will slide. I'm not sure I entirely understand the homescreen either, I feel like something like this is much more suited to a portfolio like website, where there would be a reason to list who you are and your contacts.

                        <h2 class="datemobile">16 Jul</h2>
                        <p>We looked at the CSS ‘box model’ today and worked further on our small assignment to
                            replicate a part of existing website. I chose the stickied navigation bar thing from the
                            Helvetica Now website. I really struggled with emulating this because I couldn’t figure out
                            how to correctly vertically centre text within a div without just estimating it with padding
                            and margins because if I did that then the website would not be responsive. This is as far
                            as I got, the biggest cause of my issues was that I needed the header and subheader within
                            the navbar thing to be in different divs so that they could be different font sizes, but
                            then this meant having to centre to divs proportionately to the centre of another which I
                            couldn’t figure out.</p>
